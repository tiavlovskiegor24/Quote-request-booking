# Quote Request Booking — Order-Theoretic Notes

This repo contains a single write-up, `booking_probability.md`, that rephrases container-shipping quote acceptance/rejection in terms of total orders and quantile embeddings. It also includes supporting figures in `figures/`.

## Contents
- `booking_probability.md` — main document explaining market and carrier quantile mappings, feasibility relations, rejection/booking curves, and SSR context.
- `figures/` — diagrams for market feasibility, carrier subset embedding, carrier feasibility, and willingness-to-pay geometry.

## How to view
- Open `booking_probability.md` directly in your editor or render it in any Markdown viewer.

## Editing tips
- Keep formulas in quantile coordinates after section 4.
- Reference figures with relative paths (e.g., `figures/market_feasibility_relation.jpg`).
