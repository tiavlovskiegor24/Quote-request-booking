## 2. Market Rates Respect the Same Ordering

We similarly assume the market has an ordered set of rates:

$$
R_{\\text{market}}.
$$

There is a one-to-one **monotone map**:

$$
m : Q_{\\text{market}} \\to R_{\\text{market}}
$$

assigning each request the “market-clearing” rate.

### Meaning of monotonicity

If one request is less sensitive and sits higher in the order, the rate assigned to it must not be lower than that of a more sensitive request.
