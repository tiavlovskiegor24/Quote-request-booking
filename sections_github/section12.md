## 11. Closing Thoughts

Under the total-order assumption:

- accept/reject = comparing quantiles  
- WTP = maximum feasible rate  
- carrier demand = market subset  
- carrier rejection curve = head probability (booking is its complement)  
- **SSR = a chosen point balancing rate and rejection**

This framework generalizes to multidimensional request spaces and non-total orders.
